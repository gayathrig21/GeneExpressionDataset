# Gene-Expression-Dataset Analysis and ML Models
Gene Expression dataset comes from a proof-of-concept study published in 1999 by Golub et al. It showed how new cases of cancer could be classified by gene expression monitoring (via DNA microarray) and thereby provided a general approach for identifying new cancer classes and assigning tumors to known classes. These data were used to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

# Problem Statement
There are two datasets containing the initial (training, 38 samples) and independent (test, 34 samples) datasets used in the paper. These datasets contain measurements corresponding to ALL and AML samples from Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood. Intensity values have been re-scaled such that overall intensities for each chip are equivalent.

-To build varous ML model to claasify the patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
